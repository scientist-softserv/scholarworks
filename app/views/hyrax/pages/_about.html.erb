  These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user
  friendly for everyone.
</p>

<p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for
  ScholarWorks.</p>

<p>We have worked hard on ScholarWorks and believe we have achieved our goal of Level AA accessibility. We monitor the
  website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.
